# MedCom Acknowledgement - WORK IN PROGRESS! 
<!-- HomePage -->
This page presents [MedCom's](https://www.medcom.dk/) Acknowledgement FHIR&reg;&copy; standard (Dansk: Kvittering). The purpose of the standard is to respond to the reception of the original sent FHIR message  and inform how it was received in the Danish healthcare system. That is, did the original message comply with the profile and was the receiving system able to save the message data into the system. The Acknowledgement is sent as a message and therefore follows the general MedCom FHIR messaging structure, except that the carbon-copy destination is not allowed. The Acknowledge message is released when the receiving system receives the originally sent message from the sending system.
The standard will in time replace the existing standards called <a href="http://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Den%20gode%20CONTRL/XML/Dokumentation/" target="_blank">XCTLO2</a> &
<a href="http://svn.medcom.dk/svn/releases/Standarder/Den%20gode%20CONTRL/XML/Dokumentation/" target="_blank">XCTLO2</a>.

The Acknowledgement FHIR standard contains following profiles: 
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-acknowledgement/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-acknowledgement.html" target="_blank">MedComAcknowledgementMessage</a>
* <a href="https://build.fhir.org/ig/medcomdk/dk-medcom-acknowledgement/StructureDefinition-medcom-messaging-acknowledgementHeader.html" target="_blank">MedComAcknowledgementMessageHeader</a>

## 1 Standard Documentation 
The standard documentation below provides the necessary content to understand the needs for modernization, the role of the Acknowledgement message, what to implement and how to get a MedCom certificate. The standard documentation for Acknowledgement includes:
  * Use cases
  * Technical Specifications in terms of the relevant IGs and clinical introduction to the content of the IG.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<!-- ### 1.1 Clinical Guidelines 

The clinical guidelines is the foundation for the *STANDARDNAME* standard. It describes the clinical needs for the modernization, the requirement for the content of the standard and how the standard supports the business requirements. It is the primary textual part of the documentation for *STANDARDNAME*. It is important for both implementers and business specialists to understand the clinical guidelines to ensure that the implemented standard supports the requirements.

Below can the clinical guidelines in Danish and English be found:

[Danish: Sundhedsfaglige retningslinjer](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-DA.md) <br> 
[English: Clinical guidelines](assets/documents/Clinical-guidelines-ENG.md)  -->

### 1.1 Use Cases
Use cases describe the different scenarios a standard support. For a certain real-world scenario, it describes the requirements for the content of a message. The purpose of the use cases is to ensure a coherent implementation and use of the Acknowledgement. The descriptions are targeted IT-system vendors and the people responsible for the implementation in regions and municipalities.

The use cases for HospitalNotification are qualified in collaboration with EPR- and vendors catering to the municipalities.

Below can the use cases in Danish and English be found:

### 1.2 Implementation Guide
The technical specifications for the Acknowledgement standard are defined in IGs. As mentioned previously is the Acknowledgement standard composed by profiles from *NUMBER* IGs and terminology from one IG. Links to the IGâ€™s are listed below:

  * *Insert link to ImplemantationGuides*
<p>&nbsp;</p>

IGs might be difficult for people with little or no knowledge about FHIR and how to understand an IG. Therefore has MedCom developed a webpage describing the content of the Acknowledgement standard. The link below gives an overview of which profiles are included, what their purpose are, and which elements that shall be supported in a system. Further the structure of the standard is described and supported with examples in different degree of technical skills.
